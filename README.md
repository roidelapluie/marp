```

## For developers

### Getting started

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Customizing Slide CSS

It's easy, include a `<link>` tag at the top of your presentation, or alternatively a `<style>` tag that contains all of your styles. All CSS should be targeting either `.slide` or elements inside of `.slide`. For reference, check out the gaia theme in the sass folder.

### Create release builds

```
yarn gulp release
```

Please set application version in `package.json`.

#### OS specific

##### Windows

If you want to build for Windows in other platforms, please install [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) to rewrite Electron's resources.
